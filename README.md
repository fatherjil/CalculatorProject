# Calculator Project
Led a group of 4 students to create and design a calculator application using Python's Tkinter GUI toolkit. The GUI displays widgets and buttons that enable the input of number and math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root calculations). 
Implemented a feature to store and display previous calculations, inputs, and currency conversions for user reference. 
Integrated a currency conversion functionality supporting USD, EUR, and JPY. Users can input an amount, select a currency, and convert to another.
